{"name":"LineHighlight","tagline":"A bookmarklet to highlight the text line a user has clicked on.","body":"LineHighlight is a simple bookmarklet that highlights (in yellow) the text line the user clicks on. It has been developed by [Erik Zetterstr√∂m](http://www.linkedin.com/in/erikzetterstrom) and funded by [ICT Enablers](http://www.ictenablers.com).\r\n\r\nIt is intended as a tool primarily for persons with dyslexia, but can be useful for other purposes as well.\r\n\r\nLineHighlight runs on the latest Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and Safari browsers. Internet Explorer is not supported because it lacks support for the selection.modify() function.\r\n\r\nThe software is just released, so there are surely bugs. Bug reports and feature requests are most welcome.\r\n\r\nTo use this bookmarklet make a new bookmark with the following address:\r\n\r\n`javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgithub.com/ICTEnablers/LineHighlight/master/LineHighlight.js?v='+parseInt(Math.random()*99999999);})();`\r\n\r\nYou can call the bookmark whatever you like. To use it, open the page you wish to use it on and click on the bookmark. You will see a little yellow box saying \"LineHighlight\" in the lower right hand corner when LineHighlight is active.","google":"UA-48177410-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
